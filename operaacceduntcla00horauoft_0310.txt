SATIRE III.

This satire, written by way of dialogue, is intended toi-how that
all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had retii-edin·-
to the country during the Saturnalia. Damasippus, a stoic phi-
losopher, pays him a visit, and in conversation blames hun for not
writing· and publishing something neW, instead of remaining idle,
or retouching his former works. The discourse, by an easy tran-
sition, turns upon Damasippus and his mode of life. This leads.
to an explanation of ‘the doctrines of the stoics, and a 'jastifica'tion¹
of their· dogmas, The various passions, which tyrannize over th&
human heart, are portrayed with inimitable skill. The whole
conversation is interspersed with moral reflections· and useful
instruction.
