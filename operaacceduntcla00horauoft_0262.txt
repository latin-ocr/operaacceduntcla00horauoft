In this little ode Horace declares that he will not in future heark·

en to the dictates of a hurt'ful passion, to which he had been too >

long a slave. And it must be said, to his credit, that he did actu-
ally give up, at the age of forty, when -this ode was written, his
former habits of sensual indulgence. Though from what he says,

we have some reason to believe that resentment had some share J

in forming the resolution todo so. Ι

of some god the instrumente of an art„ which was discontin-

known. Nor are the circumstances or obJect of the contemplated
νοῗῗὲῗηιέἓοῖθῖῗίῗῗιῗιονωι the drist of these twelve lines seems to
be this: May all those omens, which are usually esteemed inau-
spicious by persons about to commence a journey‚ happen to the
wicked3 but may those be favorable which attend the , departure
of her for whose safety I am anxious.-Impios . . . ducat .· ‘ may
the cry of an ill-omened bird attend the guilty? It is not certain
what kind of bird is meant by parra! ’
