EPISTLE Ι.

Avensa-us had complained that Horace had notaddressed any
of his Satires or epistles to him. In this beautiful and finished
epistle the poet makes amp1e amends for his former remissness.
In the first part of it he examines the comparison between the
ancients and the moderns, which has been matter of dispute in
alleges. He next shows thefolly of that excessive love of an-
tiquity, which regarded the time of any performance rather than
its merite. In the third place he treats of the theatre‚ and of the
difficulty of succeeding there. And finally he would remind
princes how important it is for them to encourage a spirit of emu-
latiiokn for-(ppie poetry, by which their own achlevements may be
ce e rate . ·
