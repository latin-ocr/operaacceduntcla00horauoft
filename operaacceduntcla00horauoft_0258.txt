ODE XIII.

The Romans· believed that many of their gods passed their sunr-
mers in one country, and their winters in another. Faunus was
of this number. He was supposed to come into Italy on the laur
of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5th of December.
Both these days were observed by sacrifices and festivity in hon-
or of Faunus, who was supposed to preside over their flocks and
fie.lds This ode was probably written for one of his festivals.
In the first part, the poet entreats FaunuS, if he pays him due hon·
ors, to smile upon his fields, and preserve the tender offsprin os
his fiocks3 and ιιι the second, he sets torth the Joy of the age
on the return of his autumnal feast, when man and beust will re-
lax from their toil, and rejoice in the bounty of their benefactor.

-ODE XIV.

It seems that Murena had been chosen augur, and that severa}
of his friends had met together in honor of the occasion3 and that
among them were Horace, and another poet named TelephuS, who
was a great scholar, and who undertook to entertain the company
with some grave discussion on ancient history. Horace interrupts
him by intlmating that it were better to inquire where the best
wine was to be had, with the requisites for an entertainment that
they might drink their friend’ s health ιιι honor of his new appoint-
ment. The hint succeeded, and we are to imagine our poet in
the midst of the entertainment, giving orders for the manner of
drinking, as though he were king of the feast.

ed between Inachus and CodruS, who devoted himself to death for
