ODE XXIII’.

Ἧιε occasion of this ode is not known3 although it has been the
subject of various conjectures, It is a dialogue, represented as
having taken place between a mariner and the shade‘ of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher of Tarentum.

Archytas had been shipwrecked on the coast of Apulia3 and
the poet represents a mariner, who had accidentally found his
body driven ashore by the waveS, as thus exclaiming: ‘ And could
not you escape death, ArchYtas! How small a space you cover,
who could measure the heavens, the earth, and the sea? The ad·
dress of the mariner occupies the first six verses; and the reply
continues through the ode. .

munera exigui pulveris cohibent· te, mensorem maris et terroe arence-

the wide {xtended egeam, and the land. But Dagien Gesner, and
others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little
duat to cover your body detains you from the Elysian fields 3’ allu-
ding to the prevailing belief that the sou] could not pass the Styx
un er a hundred yearS, if the body were not buried. To this, ref-
erence is made at the conclusion of the ode, where the mariner is'
entreated to render this little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.

¹7. Oceidit: The shade of Archytas here replies to this effect:
‘ Do not be surprised, mariner, that I have shared the common lot
of humanity; for Tantalus died, though he was admitted to the
society of the ςῗὸἰες and Tithonus, Pythagoras? διο. Archytas
