ODE 1. 5⁶-

Tms ode is supposed'to- have been written by Horace, aster the ”·
completion of some of his works, as a dedication of them to Mece-
nas, his patron and friend.' The poet describes with ‘much felicity
the different views of rnen with respect to happiness, and* p'ortrays
some of their ruling passione. In conclusion, he compliments
Maecenas on his taste for the fine arta, and his love of learning, by

 

intimating that he shall not consider his own claims to rank with ,

the lyric poets established, without the sanction of his Judgment.

cenas, so long distinguished as the* favorite of Augustae, and still
more so for the protection and encouragement which he afforded
to men of learning and of genius, was descended from the ancient

kings of Etruria or Tuscany. To him, says Mr. Sanadon, the pres· j

ent world is in a great measure indebted for all the wit and learn-

ing of the Augustan age3 and even at this day the name of Marce· ²
nas is a title not unworthy of persons of the noblest character, who 4
know, like him, how to animate the spirit of emulation among wri'· ³

ters by their favor and generosity. η
2. Ο et praesidium: with much propriety Horace addresses him

as his guardian and delightful honor; since Maecenas not only i

procuret] his pardon from Augustu5‚ for fighting against him with '²

Brutus and the republicans at Philippi, but even brought him into s

peculiar favor with that illustrious personage.

6. Dominos .· this word must be referred to deos,- and is not the -
object of evehit, as some have supposed, applying it to the Ro· ³

mztis-Hunc .· sc. juvat3 i. e. one ambitious of politica] distinction. ' 3
8. Terg-eminis tollere honoribus .· ‘to raise him to the highest ,ἒ

honora? The word tergemimk is probably used in reference to ..
the three highest grades of office among the Romans, viz. the aedile-

ship, the proetorship, and the consulship.

9. Illum.- sc. juvat ,· i. e. another, whose ruling passion is .

wealth.
