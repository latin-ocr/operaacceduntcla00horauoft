Antonius Musa, physician to Augustus, had recommended the
cold bath to'Horace‚ who practised cold bathing in Clusium and
Gabii. But finding the winter too severe, he resolved to go to
some warnier climate, and try sea-bathing. For this reason, he
writes to his friend Numonius Vale, who had been using the baths
at Velia and Salernum, to give him some account of the climate,
-people, accommodationffi dcc. The beginning of thi- epistle is
very much transposed and confused. Wemust look as far as the
twenty-fourth verse before we can get the· natural arrangement
of the thoughts,

1. Qaae επ hiem .· before taking in this, it seems necessary to
bring in the twenty-fourth verse: Par est te scribere nobis, ac
nos accredere tibi, quae sit hiems Veliae3 i. e. you must write to
me, Vala„ what kind of winter you have at Velia, and what the
climate of Salernum3 what is the character of the inhabitants,
and how the roads are 3 for Antonius Musa assures me that the
waters of Baiae are useless to me. . ,

3. Illis .· i. e. to the people at' Baiae,for slighting their warm
baths. , ⁴

5. Sanc . . . gemit.- ‘indeed the village is vexed that their
myrtle groves and sulphur baths should be neglected, so long
farned for driving away maladies settling on the nei-ves!

13. Sed . . . in ore .· ‘ but to horses the ear is in the bitted mouth!

21. Tractus uter . . . a ros: i. e. utra regio, Velioenc an Salerni?
‘which region produces ares in greatest abundance‚ and which
wild boars.’ ,

23. Pinguis . . . Phaeaaeque: ‘plump, and a real Phaeaciam’
i. e. similis Alcinoo luxurioso reg-i Phaeacum. ’

32. Tcmidis: these are they who, fearing the slanderous dis·
position of Maenius, entertained him in hope of escaping· his cal-
ummeS. .

35. Scilicet. . . Bestius .- ‘ forsooth, like the reformer Bestius,
he would declare all the while that the bellies of gluttons o ht
to be branded with a hot iron.'—-.Nepotum .- ‘of gluttons.’ he
Greeks and Romans branded the belly of a gluttonous slave 3 the
feet of a fugitive 3 the hands of a thief, and the tongue of a bab-
bler. Dacier.

39. Bona .- ‘their estates!

41. N’imirum . . . sum .· ‘in fact, just such a one am 1.’
