14. mium . . . Thetidis .· Achilles. Thetis, the mother of
Achilles, was warned by an oracle, that, if he went to the siege of
Troy with the other Grecian princes, he would be slain there. To
prevent him from going, she caused him to be clad in female at-
tire, and sent to the court of Lycomedes, that he might pass for
one of his daughterS, and escape discovery. But as another ora-
cle had declared that Troy could never be taken without Achilles,
Ulysses was sent in quest of him, and had the art to discover him
by placing among some female ornaments exhibited before the
daughters of Lycomedes a splendid swerd, which was instantly

⁴ seized by Achilles.

15. Virilis cultus .· ‘ his male attire :’ i. e. a boy's dress.

'ODE VIII.
t ·> It would seem, from the tenor of this ode, that something had

’ happened to disturb and depress the mind of Thaliarchus3 and

that Horace, to enliven his friend, addressed this ode to him.
It is highly colored with our poet's Epicurean principles, and
it enforces his favorite doctrine, that *man should not trouble

- himself about futurity, and that alihe has to do is to make the most

of present enjoymentS‚ and to leave the rest to the gods.

Some have supposed Thaliarchus to be a fictitious name3 and
that the whole is an imitation of an ode of Alcaeus.

1. Alta stet nive candidum Soracte .· Soracte, now vulgar-ly called
Sant Oreste, a corruption of its modern name, Santo Silvestro, is a
high mountain of Etruria. Itis of a conical form, situated on a
plain, and wholly detached from· the range of the Apennines, which
passes near it. The Tiber sweeps by its base. This mountain,
though thirty miles from Rome, is distinctly seen from that city,
and it forms avery picturesque object in the distance. During the
winter of 1829—3Q1 observed that the Apennines were white with
snow at times when Soracte was free from it. May not the circum-
stance of this mountain being covered with deep snow be alluded
to by our poet to imply that the winter was unusually severe?

8. Diotd, .· this was an earthen vessel, containing about nine
gallons,=with two eat-S, or handles, by which it was carried—Sabi-
mi: i. e. in which Sabine wine has been put.

14. Quem . . . appone .· ‘every day which fortune shall bestow,
set down to your {rainl—Quemcunque is divided by tmesis.

16. Puer .· ‘ while young.'

18. Campus, et areae .· i. e. the Campus Martius, and other open
places, as courts and squares, in which the young of both sexes
used to meet for play.

19. Lenesqtoe . . . susum-i.- i. e. the sost whispers of lovers, who
met at these soenes of youthful recreation.
