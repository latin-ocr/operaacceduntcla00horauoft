ODE x1v. ἓ
Palinodia signifies a ·‘recantation,’ or the retra-cting' of what has
been said. It seemS, our poet, having been supfflanted by a more
successful competitor for the favor of Tyndaris, the daughter of
Gratidia, wrote an abusive and scurrilous ode to her. He now
wishes to retract what he had done, and to reInstate himselfin the
favor of Tyndaris, to whom he was much attached. He pleads,
as his excuse, the influence of irresistible passion, and denies ever
having indulged the feelings expressedin his former ode.
1. Matre pulchra .· The former ode is said to have begun thus!
O matre turpifilia turpior!
2. Quem . . . Hadriano .· Quem cunque is divided by tmesis.
‘ You will destroy, in any way you please, my slanderous Iambics3
whe’ther you see fit to throw them into the fire, or into the Adriatic ‚ ε
sea. v · 38
5. Dindymene .· i. e. Cybele, so called from Dindymus, or Din- ’ ’
dymis, a mountain in Phrygia consecrated to her service and wor-

. ship.

11. 'fremendo . . . tumultu .· ‘ with his dread thunderbolts)

13. Fertur Prometheus . . . desectam .- i. e. Prometheus, when, on
account of the failure of his materials, which were exhausted in
making other animals, he was compelled to blend in the first form-
ed man a particle (undique desectam) taken from every other ani-
* mal, is said also to have placed in our breast something of the fury
. of the raging lion. ' .

Therefore, the poet would argue, he may justly hope for pardon
for an act proceeding from an infirmity of human nature, ’

17. Thyesten.- the dreadful effects of passion may be learned
from the story of Thyestes. See Class. Dict.

22. Pectoris . . ..fervor .· ⁶ furious anger!

25. Nunc ego . . . tm'stia: how far Horace succeeded in regain-
ing the favor of Tyndaris, we learn from the following ode to
her.

ODE XV.

Horace, having relnstated himself in the favor of Tyndaris, in- 4
vites her to his country-seat, where he offers her retirement and a · ⁴
cool retreat from the heat of dog-days. ¹

1. Lucretilem mutat Lycoeo Faunus .- by hypallage, for mutat ³
Izycaeum Lucretiti. Horace’s country-seat was near the foot of
mount LucretIlis, which, he says, Faunus finds so pleasant that he l
osten forsakes his Arcadian mountain LycaeuS‚ and comes to visst,
it. He considers himself under the protection of that god, >who
defends his goats from the extremes of the weather. ·

4. Usque.- i. e. semper ‚· ‘always’

⁷. Olentis uxores mariti .· i. e. the she-gom. , ξ
