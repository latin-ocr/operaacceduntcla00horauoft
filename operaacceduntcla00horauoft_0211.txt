The compliments here paid to Augustus are the more delicate for

object of them to the very last, when the ode terminates with the
name of C'aesar. '

ODE ΙΙΙ.

Horace and Vir‘gn were closely united by the bonds of affection

and friendship, as well as by similarity of taste and kindred pur-
suits. .
This ode was written on the embarkation of virgil for Athens,
where he expected to meet the emperor, on his return from Asia.
⁴ virgil had intended to accompany Augustus in his eastern expe-
dition, but was prevented by iJl health. He, however, met him at
Athens, but he was soon aster taken ill at Me ara, and brought
back to Italy at his own request‚ and lauded at Brundusium;
where he died a few days after. So that this was in fact Horace’s
farewell address to his friend. He expresses great interest and
feeling on the occasion3 and even goes so far as to execrate the
invention of ships, and to call the art of navigation impious, as vio-
lating the intention of the gods. , .

2. Fratrw Helenae: Castor and Pollux, sons of Leda.

3. Ventorum . . . pater .· i. e. AEolus‚ whom Homer represents as
confining the winds in a bag, and Virgil as confining them in a cave.

vomblfflr those sailing from Italy to Athens. It was so called
from Iapyga, the inhabitants of Apulia, from which this wind blew

that owest to the shores of Attica virgil, intrusted to thee, 1 pray
that 'the queen of CypruS, the bright stam, Castor and Pollux, and
the sovereign of the winds, restraining all but the Iapyx, may so
direct you, that you may delivcr him in safety.’

14. Hyadas .· The H <icles are a constellation at the head of the¹
Bau, commonly known y the name of the Seven Stars. They
are called tristes, because their rising and setting are frequently
attendet} with rain. '

²18. Monstra natantia .· ‘the hideous monsters of the deep swim-

which deprived them of a buria13 as in that case they. were not per-
mitted to pass the Styx, and be at rest, for a hundred years.

20. Acroceraunia .· from ἄκρον. ‘ the summit? and κεραυνὸς, ‘thun-
der’3 a high romontory in Epirus, between the Adriatic and the
