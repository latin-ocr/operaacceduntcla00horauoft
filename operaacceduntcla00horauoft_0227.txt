ODE XXV.

Glchra, a lady of great beanty, and a friend of Horace, being
about to give an entertainment at her house, had invited him to
attend it. We may suppose, Horace, with his answer‚ to have⁴
sent this little neat and beautiful invocation to the goddess of
beauty‚ requesting her to smile on the scene.

ODE XXVI.

Augustus built a temple ιο Apollo within his palace on mount
Palatine 3 and when it was consecrated, most of the eminent poets ‘
of the age wrote something upon the occasion. It is supposed
that Horace wrote this ode, sor that solemn ceremony‚ at the re-
quest of the emperor.

1. Quid . . . vates.- ‘ what does the poet ask of Apollo, to whom
this day a temple is dedicated ?'— Vates, i. e. ego poeta. He re-
peats the question, ‘ what does he pray for ?' to give force to the
mterrogation3 because he is not about to ask for those things
which are usually most desired.
