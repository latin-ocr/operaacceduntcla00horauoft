232 · nores,

onn XI.

The shortness of life and the inevitable event of death ase very
feelingly set forth in this ode. But the argument and the infer·
ence are, as usual with our poet, employed to enforce the-doctrine
of a refined Epicureanism. Had the light of revelation been shed
on his mind, he would not only have considered the shortness 'of
life as a reason for enjoying it as it passed, which is indeed good
philosophy3 but he would also have urged the necessity of form-
ing the character for a higher and a nobler existence.v

Who the person was, that is here addressed by the name of
posthumus, or Postumus, as some say it should be written, has
not been ascertained. But it appears to have been a friend
whom Horace considered too parsimoniouS, and advises toa more
liberal enjoyment of his fortune. “ ’

23. Invisus .- ‘ forbidding,' ‘mournfuL’ The cypress was sacred
to Pluto‘and Proserpine, and it was usually placed on *the funeral
pile with the dead body. It was also placed before the door
where there was any one dead within.

24. Brevem .· ‘short-lived!

28. Pontificum potiore coeniss ‘more delicious than that used at
the suppers of the pontifis?

ODE XII.

In this ode Horace contrasts the magnificence of the Romans

of his time, in their buildings, plantatione, gardens, and pleasure Α

grounds, with the frugality of their ancestors3 who consideredthe
public edifices, and the temples of the gods, the noblest- monu-
ments of real grandem, as well as of piety.

1. Jam .· ‘ shortly,' ‘ soon.’——Regiae moles .· ‘the princely edifices?

4. Stagna: ‘fish-pondS.’ By these the poet probably means „-

large portions of· salt water enclosed from the sea by artificia] piers
and dykes.—Platanu3.· ‘ the plane trce' was planted for ornament
only 3 whereas the elm was useful for the vines to run upon.

6. Et, omnis . . . narium .· ‘ and* the whole tribe ofsweet-scented
flogezsienilibus . . . priori .- ‘ which were formerly profitable totheir
owssiiels-i'am .· ‘soon ;’ i. e. the laurel will be made to·grow so thick,
for the comfort of those walking, that the rays of the sun will be
excludcd from the ground. ·-
