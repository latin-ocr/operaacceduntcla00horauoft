ᾖν THE LIFE OF HoRAcE.

court. He was subject to a defluxion in the eyes3 as was virgi}
to a complaint of asthma3 and Augustus used to rally the two
poets, by saying, “ that he sat between sighs and tearS.”' He had
a farm in the country of the Sabines‚ and a house at Tibur, now
Tivoli, the ruins of which are still shown to strangerS. He died
in his fisty-ninth year3 so suddenly that he lestno will, and his
property therefore reverted to the emperor. He was buriedin the
cemetery on the Esquiline ΗὶΙΙι near the tomb of Maecenas.

The writings of Horace have an air of frankness and openness
about them 3 a manly simplicity, and a contempt of affectation, or
the little pride of a vain and mean concealment, which, at once,
take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
he gives of his own character, without scruple or suspicion. That-
he was fond of pleasure is confessed3 but, generally speaking, he
was moderate and temperate in his pleasures3 and his convivial
hours seem to have been far more intellectual, and more enlight-
ened by social wit and wisdom, than are those ofthe common herd
of Epicurean poets.

Horace, of all the writers of antiquity, most abounds with that
practica] good sense, and familiar observation of life and mannerS,
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader’s
companion. Good sense, in fact, seems the most distinguishing
'feature of his satires; for his wit seems rather forced3 and it is
their tone of sound understanding, added to their easy, conversation-
al air, and a certain turn for fine raillery, that forms the secret by
which they please. In variety and versatility, his lyric genius is
unrivalled by that of any poet with whom we are acquainted3 and
there are no marks of inequality or of inferiority to himself.
Whether his odes be of the moral and philosophie kind3 or the
heroic ; the descriptive3 or the amatory, the light, aud the joyous3-
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar province. «
His epistles evince a knowledge of the weaknesses of the human
heart, which would do honor to a professed philosopher, What
Quintilian, and the moderns-aster him, call the ‘⁴ Art of Poetry,”⁵
seems to have been only the third epistle of the second book, ad-
dressed to the PisoS. The style and manner differ in no respect
stom the former epistles. The observatione are equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokes of satirical humor; which

appear unsuitable to a didactic pisce*
