SATIRE III.

The poet would show, in this satire, that the faults of friends

maintained that all should be punished with equal severity.

commentatore make summa and ima to agree with chorda, and to

tetrachord, Aecording to this interpretation, summa and imo,
referring to the12r4p2sit10n, would express ‘the base and treble.’
