· 11. Pontica pinus .- the pine from Pontus was most esteemed for
’ 1ρᾶ.ΜιΡσὲ sollicitum . . . levis .· i. e. may you, who were but re-
·cently an object of great anxiety to me, when in danger of being
lost, now that you are saved from wreck, an object of tender con-
cern amd care, avoid the seas flowing among the shining Cycla-
des. These islands are termed nitentes, from the white marble,
which rendered them very conspicuous and beautiful.. They are
about fisty in number, and so near together as to render the navi-
gation among them eXtremely dangerous3 and are therefore to be
avoided.

ODE XIII.

It is supposed that Horace addressed this ode to Mark Antony,
attho time he was ensnared by the love of Cleopatra, and was
me'dltating an expedition with her against Italy, that he might make
her mistress of the Roman empire, to dissuade him from that des-
perate enterprise. Torrentius says, that he saw an ancient manu-
script, in which the title of this ode was, Ad Alexandrum Paridem.
And there is little doubt but a parallel is here intended between
Paris and Antony3 each of whom embarked for his own country
with a foreign queen, to the ruin of himself and those connected
with him.

1. Pastor .- Paris‚ in consequence of his mother’s dream, thathe
would be the destruction of Troy and of Priam's house, was sent
away as soon as he was born, and committed to a shepherd on
mount Ida, to be brought up to that mode of life, in ignorance of
his parentage. Aster he was received and acknowledged at court,
ge dwas frequently called Pastor Dardanus, ‘the Trojan shep-

er .’ ’ v

2. Perfidus.- Paris was a visitor at the palace.of Menelaus, at
the time he committed the treacherous and infamous violation of
hospitality, which gained him this epithet.

5. Mala . . . avi.- ‘with inauspicious omen.’ The Romans fre·
quently took their omens from birds.

7. Conjurata: the Grecian princes assembled with their forces
at Aulis, where they bound themselves by an oath not to return
till the had destroyed the kingdom of Priam‚ and avenged the in-
sult o cred to their nation.

21. Laertiaden .- Ulysses.

,²6⁶ Non aur-iga piger.- ‘a spirited driver,’ when occasion re-
quires.

32. Non hoc . . . tuae .· i. e. quite different from what you boast-
ed to your beauteous Helen. .

33. boemia . . . Achillei.- i. e. the quarrel of Achilles with
Agamemnon will, for a. while, defer the fatal day for Troy and the
Trojan ladies. Females are mentioned as particularly objecta of
pity in the sacking· of a city. Achillei· from the old Achilleus. ’
