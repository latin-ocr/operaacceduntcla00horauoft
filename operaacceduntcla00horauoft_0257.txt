ODE XII.

AElius Lamias, to whom this ode was addressed, was a. ¹person
of illustrious family and considerable estate. He had risen by his
personal merit to the rank of lieutenant-general in the Spanish
war under Augustus. He so demeaned himself in this office as to
gain the esteem and respect of the army. Horace therefore com-
pliments him on the hereditary honors, which he so well sustain-
ed 3 and upon which his own character and achievements had shed
additional lustre. And since he predicts a storm on the morrow,
he invites Lamias to pass the day with him.

1. AEli . . . late tyrannus.- the construction is, AEli, nobilis ab
vetusto Lamo, quando serunt et priores Lamias hinc denominatos
esse, et omne genua nepotum per memores fastos dimit originem ab
illo auctore, qui princeps dicztur incoluisse naenia Formiarum, et
late tyrannus tenuisse In’m'm innantem littoribus Maricae.

2. Hinc: i. e. a Lamo ,· from this Lamus, king of the Lksffygd-
nes, the former Lamiae derived their name.

4. Paeto-5.- these were the registers or annals, in which was
kept the record of the family of the Lamioe, as well as that ofoth-
er noble familieS, and of public affairs.

7. Et innantem . . . Lirim .· i. e. and held under his sway the
river Liris, which flows into the sea through the marshes of Min-
turnae. “Ager Minturnensis designatur per fluvium Ia'n‘m, qui il-
lum transit, et per paludes Minturnenses in mare diffunditur.”
Boea—Marica: Marica was a nymph, the wife of Faunus, und
mother of Latinus, who presided over Minturnae, and the regions
about it; hence littoribus Marieae, for ‘ the marshes of Minturnae.’
