EPISTLE II.

Julius Florus, to whom¹ this epistle is addressed, was, at the
time it was written} absent with Tiberius Nero. Horace gives
his reasons for not having complied with the request ‘oi' Florus
that he would send him some lyric poems. He tells him that he
wished to devote himself to the study of philosophy. And
throughout the epistle he interspeurses many excellent precepts
for the regulation of the conduct, and for securing a good and
happy life. He commences with a lively and amusing account
of a slave-dealer‚ as an example of the verbosity and knavery of
that class of men.

12. Meo . . . aere .- ‘ I am short for money, but owe nobody.’

14. Semel hic cessavit .- ‘ he was once in fault3 and hid himself
behind the stairs for fear of the whip, as was natural enough-⁷
Doe'ring prefers this construction to pendentis in scalis, the usual
one. The seller uses the word cessavit for ausu 't‚· to sosten
the crime of running away, which was considere so important
a defect in the character of a slave, that the sale was made void
by laW, if this was not mentioned to the purchaser.

17. Ille .· i. e. the slave-dealer who sells the slave—Pomm se-
curus .· ‘fearless of any punishment‚' for the fraud he committed3
as the law could not reach him, aster he bad mentioned the fact
that the slave had run away.

23. Quid . . . attentas .- ‘what then have I gained by my conces-
sion‚ if, neverthffless, you impeach the laws protecting me ,θ’-Μο-
cum facientia .- i. e. me adjuvantia. Jaeck.

43. Bonae Athenae .· ‘kind Athens.'

48. Non responsura lacertis .· ‘ unable to cope with the arms,’
or forces of Augustus Caesar.

52. Sed quod . . . versus .· i. e. but now possessing every thing
that I wish, what doses of hellebore could cure my madness if
did not think it better to sleep quie'tly than to attempt writing
