EPODE IV.

In this epode the poet inveighs vehemently against some per-
son, who, from the condition of a slave, had become a military
tribune, and was making an offensive display of his wealth and
dignity, to the annoyance of the more reputable part of the com-
munity. It is commonly supposed to be addressed to Menas, a
freedman of Cneus Pompey, and ιιι most manuscripts it is inscrib-
ed to him. ι

follow, who had been a slave, takes his place ιιι the first seatS, which
welre appropriated exclusively to those born knights.
