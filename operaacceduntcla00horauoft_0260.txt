ODE XVII.

*Phidyle was a rustic woman, and, as most& commentators sup-
pose, the poet’s house-keeper in the country. She seems to have
imbibed the opinion that sacrifices to the gods were more or less
acceptable in proportion to their intrinsic value. Horace in this
ode attempts to convince her, that the gods regarded the disposi-
tion of mind with which sacrifices were offered, rather than the
costliness of the gifts ; that purity of life and good intentions were
of most importance3 and that with these, any offerings‚ however
small, were acceptable.

1. Supinas.- when the ancients prayed to the celestial gods,
they raised their hands ‘with the palms upwards3’ but turned
them downwards when they addressed the infernal godS.

2. Nascente ΙΛιηᾶ .· the occasions were very numerous on which

’ it was supposed proper to make sacrifices to the gods3 Horace

would imply that once a mouth, ‘ at the new moon,' was sufficient,
and then it was not necessary to be extravagant. ,

3. Hormi .· i. e. praesentis anni. Adj. hamus, -a, -τιπι, -

7. Dulces alumni: i. e. agni, haedi3 sc. sentient.

9. Nam, quae . . . tinget .- the construction ie, Nam victima diis
devota, quae pascitur nivali Algido inter quercus et ilices, aut crescit
instlba-nis herbis, tinget cervice· secures pontificum. The meaning
is, that these victims are designed for public sacrificeS, which may
with propriety be more magnificent than those of private individu-
als, who ought to make their offerings proportionate to their sta-
tion and abilities.

15. Parvos . . . myrto .· ‘ crowning your little household gods
with rosemary and tendet myrtle.’ This is enough. You need
not attempt to appease them by the slaughter of many victims.

17. Immanis .· sc. scelen's5 i. e. ‘pure.'

18. Non sum tuosd . . . micd .· ‘it has appeased the angry gods
with pious mealp and crackling salt, and *would not have been more
acceptable with a costly sacrifice?

ODE XVIII.

In this ode Horace inveighs against luxury and extravagance
as the prevailing vices of the age. The ode may be considered
as consisting of three parts. In the first, the oet exposes the
licentious enormities of the age3 in the second? he shows their
causes 3 and in the third, points out their proper remedies.

1. Intactis . . . caput .· the construction is, Licet occupes omne
atqrrhenm et Apulicum mare tuis coenaentis, opulentior intactis θω-
sauris Arabum et divitis Indice, tamen si dira Mcessitas figit ada-
maritima clavos summis verticibus, non expedies animum metu, nec
caput laqueis martia—Intactis .· i. e. “ nondum attrectatis3 inte-
