12. Domus· AEbuneae resonantis.- various have been the vcon-iem ·

tures as to the meaning of these wordS. There was at Tibur,
now Tivoli, a wood, and near it a small lake or fountain, each called
Albunea, from a Sibyl of that name, whose temple still remains al-
most entire on the rock which causes and overhangs the first and
prinoipal falls of the Anio at Tivoli. Some conunentators suppose

the poet speaks of the country-seat of Plancus near this spot, and j
some that he refers to a deep cavern in the rock just below the ,ι
falls, into which the waters rush with a great noise; while others ’

understand him to mean the temple of the Sibyl, who in her re-
'sponses is represented asreechoing the roar of the waterfaus. This

temple is certainly amost interesting ruin, and it forms at the pres· ’
ent day one of the most strikingly picturesque objects in this scene ·

of unrivalled be‘auty.

⁴21. Teucer . . .sugeret: ‘ when Teucer fled from his native Sa-
lamisand from his father.' Telamon, king of Salam, sent his
two som, Teucer and Ajax, to the Trojan war, under an in-
junction that neither should return without his brother. When
Teucer returned, aster the death of Ajax, he was banished by his

father, and went to CypruS‚ where he built another Salamis. The ¹

{oet here reminds Plancus, that Teucer did not allow himself to
e· depressed, although banished from his home and country ; and
that he, therefore, should call some of his friends about him, and
regain his elasticity of spirit. =
ὡ25. Melior fortuna parente .· ‘fortune, more kind than my fa-
er.'
29. Ambiguam .- i. e. he would build a new SalamiS, which
should so rival the old, as to render it doubtful which of them was
spoken of when the name of Salamis should be used.

ODE VII.

In this ode, addressed to Lydia, a female of great beauty‚ but'of
worthless character, Horace draws the picture of a youth who has
become the victim of a deep and destructive passion.

2. Sybarin . . . perdere .· ‘why are you hastening to destroy Sy-
baris by cherishing his guilty passion ?’ s

Sybaris, a youth of fortune and of ingenuous character, having
yielded to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his manly
exercises and his former companionS, and was hastening to de-
struction by that fatal infatuation which has led more youths to
perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices. « ’

6. Impatis: the Romans had a: kind of curb bits called raem'
lupati, stom their resemblance to the uneven teeth os a wo lu-
pag. Olivum: the ancients anointed their bodies with oil before
commencing their gymnastic exerciseS.

10. Dim'da: i. e. bruised by wearing heavy armor.
