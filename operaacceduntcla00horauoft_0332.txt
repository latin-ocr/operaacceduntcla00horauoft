324 norm. · Ῥ

21. Rom-.- i. e. when you are at Rome, let Samos, Chios and
Rhodes be praised.

25. Nam si. .oeusert.· ‘for if reason and prudence only, and
no situation, however commanding its prospect over the expand-
ed ocean, can dispel our cares!

Erisrnn ΧΠ.

This e pistle 1s addressed to the same person to whom Horace
addressedp the XXIVth Ode of the first Book. He there rallies
Iccius with some humor on turning soldier, and abandoning his
literary and philosophical pursuits. He now ridicules his love of
money, blended with those pursuits.

1. fluctibus Agrippae Siculis.- Iccius waS‚ at the time this e pis-
·tle was addressed to him, agent and superintendent of the estates
of Agrippa' 111 Sicily3 an office of no trifiing emolument. ·

7. In medio positorum: ‘in the midst of abundance spread , ι

out before you)

l2. Miramur si.- i. e. can we wonder that the fields and crops
of Democritus became the prey of flockS‚ while his mind was
searching for the hidden causes of things3 when you, amidst so
corrupt an age, where the love of gain spreads like a contagion‚
withdraw your mind from all low inquiries, and employ yourself
in the sublime study of nature? This 1s probably irony, for the
poet' s amusement.

21. Seu pisces, seu porrum .· a humorous allusion to the doctrines
of Pythagorae, who taught that the soul, in its transmigratione,
passed into plants as well as animale. ’

22. Utere . . . ultro defer .· ‘ give a kind reception to Pompeius
Grosphus3 and if he request anything‚ grant it readily.’

24. Vilis. .edeest ‘the harvest of friends to be acquired is
cheap, when good men need anything.' Because they can be
lgained by a trifiing favor, wanting nothing but what is just and

onorable.

28. Accepit genibus minor.- ‘has received on bended knees. ’

EPISTLE XIII.

It seems our poet had intrusted several rolls of his writings‚
volumina, to his friend Vinius Asella, to be carried to Augustus».
But he was anxious that they should be presented at a proper
time, when he might not be employed by more weighty comet-1133
and that they should not, through too much zeal on the part of
his friend, be urged upon the emperor unseasonably.

2. Signata.- he wished them to be delivered scaled, that they
might not be the subject of impertinent curiosity to the courtiers.
