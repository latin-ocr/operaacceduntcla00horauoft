EPODE X.

Horace exhorts his friends to seize every occasion of enjoying
life while it is in their power to do so, and especially to pass with
him a rainy day in conviviality. He enforces his argument by re·-
presenting the Centaur Chiron as giving the same advice to his

pupil Achilles, aster he had informed him that it was decreed by
fate that he should perish at Troy. .’

EPODE XI.

The civil war between Caesar and Pompey had been succeeded
by that between Octavius and Brutus; and when these commo·
tions had come to an end, others arose between Octavius, then
called AugustuS, and Antony. The Roman empirc. was divided
between these chiefs, and the Adriatic was covered with their
fleets. A battle was expected, which was to decide the fate of
the empire. On the eve of this dreadful scene, Horace composed
this epode, in which he deplores the condition of the Roman peo-
ple, and intimates that they may as well abandon their country
for ever, as live amidst such soenes of horror and uncertainty. In
short, the civil warS, which began between Marius and Sylla m
the year 666 of Rome, were never perfectly extinguished till the
death of Antony in 724. ’
