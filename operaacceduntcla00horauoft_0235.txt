{might of high standing. He was a poet and a soldier. He had
been eschaol-felium a long-tried and ¹intimate friend of Horace,
who here tells him, that, as they had passed the best of their days
together in ‘voille and dangers, he ,now wishes to retire with him,

> ‘v seat at Tibur, or with Septimius at Tarentum.
