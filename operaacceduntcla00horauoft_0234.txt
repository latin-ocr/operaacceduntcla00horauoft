ODE III.

Dellius was a man of fickle and inconstant character, who 13
said to have changed sides four times during the civil wass.
When this ode was written, he seems to have been in a state of
dej ection, on account of the condition of his affairs. The poet ex-
110113 him to preserve equanimity of temper under all circum-
stances3 since the shortness of life ienders it of comparatively
little importance whether a man be rich or poor. But 6 reasonable
and innocent enjoyment of one’s possessione is the truest wisdom.
