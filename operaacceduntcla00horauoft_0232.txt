ODE. 1.

Asmn‘is Ponto, a soldier, a. statesman‚ and a scholar, had also
distinguished himself as a tragic writer3 and had raised the repu-

² tation eof the Rorrau stage nearly to an equality with that of A‘th-

ens. But Pollio was engaged 1n a work better deserving his whole
strength and attention. This was a history of the civ1l wars, in
which he had already advanced considerably, when Horace, ap-
prehensive that the applause which Poli‘ro received from the stage
might interrupt a history so interesting to the republic, wrote this
Ode to urge him to persevere. And at the same time he exhorts
Pollio not to be diverted from this object, he reminds him how deli-
cate and dangerous a task he had undertaken.

1. Motum ex Metello: the construction is, Ο Pollio, tractas cim-
cum motam ez· con-s· de Metello, causasque beili, διο.

It was during the consulship of Metellus and Lucius Afranius,
that Caesar, Pompey and Crassus formed that consederat-‚y com-

monly known by the name of the Firs t Triumvirate. The poet'

sayS‚ You treat of the civil commotioris which took place, begin-
ning from the consulship of Metellus. - .

3³? Gravesque.. ‚amicitiast i. e. the coalition of the fflumvin',
so destructive to the liberty of the commonwealth.

6. Periculosae: this might 'well be called‘ a work full of danger
ous chance? since the fidelity of the historiari mus t be preserved,
without offending Augustus, or disobliging many families that had
been deeply engaged in the civil war, by opening afresh wounds
that were now nearly healed.

9. 9.Mu,aa tragoediae desit theatm'se i. e. relinquish for a time o'ur
favorite pursuit, and abstain from writing tragedies, tin you ave
put the finishing hand to a. work of so much importance as that
in which you are engaged.

10. Mox. ‚cothurnot ‘‚hereaster when you shall have digest-
ed and arranged the events in your history, you shall resume the
noble employment of writing tragedy with true Athenian dig-
nit

'iiie cothurnus, 01· buskin‚ was frequently put for tragedy‚ which
had at that time reached a greater degree of excellence at Athens
than at any other place.

From the expression publicas res ordinem, many have supposed
Pollio was consul at the time this ode was written, and that this
sentence had reference to the management of public business.
