Rome and Athens. Aster enjoying the best means of in-
struction that Rome afforded, at the age of about twenty- one, Hor-
ace was sent to Athens to complete his education. Whils't Horace
was at Athens, Caesar was assassinated 3 and Brutus and Cassius
repaired to that city, in order to enlist in the cause of freedom the
young Romans who were pursuing their studies there. Horace
attached himself to Brutus, under whom he served nearly two
years. He was in the battle of Philippi, with the rank of military
tribune. He fied m the rout of that day, and was taken prisoner3
but obtained a pardon, and afterwards was distinguished by the
favor and friendship of Maecenas, He filled the office of a clerk
to the treasury, and assisted the emperor as his private amanuen-
sis. This appears from the fragment of a letter from Augustus to
his minister. “I used to be equal to the writing of my own letters;
but Ι am now so pressed with a multiplicity of business, and so in-
firm, that Ι wish you to bring me our friend Horace. Let him come,
then, and leave that parasitica] table for my palace, and assist me
in writing my letters. '' Another fragment of a letter from Augus-
tus to Horace, is expressed m terms of the most easy and playful
familiarity. “Dionysius has conveyed your little volume to me3
which, not to quarrel with its brevity, Ι take in good part. Bui
you seem to me fearful, lest your works should gbe bigger than

ourself. However, what ou want in height, ιε made up to you
lyiy that little round body o yours. You should, therefore, write
such a roll, as may go, not round a stick, but a quart measure,
and then the circumference of your volume may be squab and
swollen, like the rotundity of your little bellyss’ This is apleasing
personal trait. Horace has, himself, given us some interesting
hints of his person and manners. He was gray before his time;
fond of basking in the sun3 and of taking a sie-sta on the bank of
a river. He speaks of breaking stones and turning up the ground,
when ιιι the country, and when ιιι town, of sauntering ιιι the mar-
ket, or riding out on a dock- tailed mule, which he sat awkwardly.
