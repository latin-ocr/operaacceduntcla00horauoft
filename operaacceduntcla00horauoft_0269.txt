ODE VI.

In this beautiful ode the poet does not merely describe the
pleasures and charms of Spring. His object seems to be to in-
culcate a moral lesson. He would show by the rapid succession
of the seasons, and the decay of all things in the vegetable king-
dom, that man himself is rapidly passing away3 and that whatever
he has to do in this life must be done quickly.
