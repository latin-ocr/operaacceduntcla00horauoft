SATIRE VII.

While Horace was military tribune in the army of Brutus, ⁸
there was in the same camp one Rupilius Rex, who, jealous of

poet, by 'way of retaliation for this insolence, takes occasion to
describe to Brutus a contest that happened one day between Rex
and one Persius, a merchant, who was there for the purpose of
trade. He gives the whole an air of solemnity which heightens
the burlesque.
