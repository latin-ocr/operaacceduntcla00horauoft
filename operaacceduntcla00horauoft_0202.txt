HoaAcs uses twenty different kinds of Measure, or varie-
ties os Metre. These are combined in sixteen different ways,
forming, of course, sixteen different StropheS, or Stanzas.* In
· order to know to· which of these combinations any ode 'be-
longs‚ we have only to find the first words of that ode in the
following Alphabetical Index ; and against them is placed the
number of the combination to which it belongs, and accOrding
to which it may be scanned. For instance 3 suppose it were
desired to know the kind of verse-'contained in the First Ode
of the First Book ; look in the Alphabetical Index on the next
page, and find there the first words‚- Maecenas αἰαὺὶες and
against them stands VII. No. VII, then, of the Combinations
on page 198, informs you that the verse is Asclepiadcam and
shows you how it may be scanned. In the same way the
method of scanning every ode in Horace may be known, by
finding the first words of it in the Index, and referring to the

number against it, in the Combinations.

*A strophe, or smum, includes as many lines as are necessary to
show all the different kinds of measure in anode. It is called strophe,
which, in Greek, literally means a turning, because, at the end of it, you
turn back to the same kind of verse with which you began.
