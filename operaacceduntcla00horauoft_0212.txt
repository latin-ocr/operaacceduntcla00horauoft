ODE V.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a distinguished general, and so
much esteemed by Augustus, that he gave him his daughter J ulia
‚in marriage. Agrippa wished his achievements to be celebrated
by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the more laborious
and responsible task of writing a formal poem, ingeniously pays
him the most flattering compliment. He intimates that Agrippa's

martial glory desei-ves the strains of a loftier genius than his own} ’-

that his was the lyric muse, and fit only for light or trifiing sub-
Jects3 but that Varius, gisted with the sublimest inspirations of the
epic muse, would sing his praisesin strains worthy of the subJect.

Most commentatore have thought this ode merely an excuse οι
Horace for not* doing that which he had no disposition to do. But
the fulness of the praises bestowed renders this conjecture super-

fluous. It is probably only an instance, among many, of hismfiri- - s

ly performing what he pretends to decline doing
