god of the Roman people.

that Jove reigns in heaven from hearing him thunder these?

conquests and his services to his country, shall be hailed as a visi-
hle divinity. Presens has this signification, and not propitius, sa-
vem, as some have supposed.

being restored to his throne, was so alarmed merely at the report
that Augustus was about to make war upon him, that he volunta·
rily sent an embassy to him, and offered to restore the military
standards that had been lost several years before at the defeat of
(ζτεεειιε. The Parthians are here meant by Persis. Augustus
did not m reality subdue either the Britons or Parthians, but the

ffilzshgrgtoed to the authority of his name. See Book Ι. Ode
