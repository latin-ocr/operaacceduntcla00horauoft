EPISTLE VIII.

This epistle 1s addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, the secretu-y
of Tiberius, who is mentioned Book Ι. Ep. III. 15. *Horace de-
scribes himself as laboring under hypochondriac affections, incon-
stant, contradictory, and unreasonable. “

1. Celso . . . Neronis .· the construction is, O Musa rogata, resur
Celso Albinovano, comiti scribaeque Neronis, gaudere et, gerere
rem bene. This is an imitation of the Greek form of salutation,
χαίρειν καὶ εὕπράττειν.· ‘ give joy and success) ⁰

3. Minantem: ‘promising,’ ‘intending.’

10. Cur . . . veterno.- ‘because they strive to rouse me from
this fatal lethargy.' C'ur is equivalent to ideo, qued. Doer. ’

12. Ventosus: ‘inconstant‚’ ‘ changeful.’

13. Rem gerat : ut scriba apud Neronem.

14. Ut placeat juveni .· ‘ how he stands with the youthful
prince,’ Tiberius Claudius Nero.—Colwrti .· ‘to the courtiers?
about the prince. *-

17. Ut tu . . ,sev-emus.- the poet bids the muse to remind his
friend Celsus, that their future intimacy will depend upon him-
self: if in his high station he does notforget his old friend, nei-
ther will that friend forget him: ‘as thou bearest thy high for·
tune, Celsus, so will we conduct ourselves towards thee.'

EPISTLE IX.

This is a letter of introduction and commendation to Tiberius
Claudius Nero in behalf of Septimius, the poet’s particular friend.
The great delicacy necessary on such an occasion is manifesssy
felt by Horace, who pleads the importunity of his friend, as an
excuse for what he does, with modesty and sceming reluctanc‘e.

1. Se timius . . ‚facias : ‘ O Claudius, Septimius alone, forsooth,
knows ow high I stand in your estee1n.' ¹

6. Quid . . . i so .- ‘he sees and understands how much influ-
ence I have wit you much better than Ι do myselfl'

10. Sic ego . . . praemia .· ‘ so I, to avoid the‘ appearance of a
greater crime (unwillingness to serve a friend), have taken upon
myself a little modest as‘surance) Descendi expresses his unwill-
ingness, and that he did not at first intend to do it.

EPISTLE xj

There are few persons insensible to the pleasures of the coun-
try. In Horace the love of rural retirement became a kind of
passion 3 and the praises he bestows in this epistle on a country life,
and on contentment with one's lot, are pleasing and instructive.
