EPISTLE IV.

The poet Tibullus, to whom this ode was addressed, was a
Roman knight of fortune, teste, and elegance. He espoused the
cause of liberty with BrutuS, and had suffered in his estate in con-

 

sequence3 as his lands were among those confiscated. Four -

books of elegies are all that remain of his works. These for
sweetness and pathos are hardly surpassed by anything in the
lan uage.

2. In regione Pedand .· ‘in the region of Pedum,' a town of La-
tium, where Tibullus had a villa.

3. Cassi Parmensis .· ‘ Cassius of Parma: He valued himself
on the fertility of his genius 3 and regarded the number of versos

he could write in a given time, rather than their excellence. ·

This is raillery in Horace.

13. Supremam : the Epicureans inculcated this maxim, that
every day was to be enjoyed as if· it were the last. Thau, if
another were given, it would be considered a gratuity, and be
the more gratefnlly received.
