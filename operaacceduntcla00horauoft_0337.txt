EPISTLE XIX,

This epistle is a satire on the poets of our author's time, who,
under pretence that Bacchus was the god of poetry‚ and that the
best ancient bards loved wine, imagined they might equal their
merit by drinking as freely. Horace laughs at such ridiculous
ἱὸιίῖᾳῐὶοη, and tallies the methodica] dullness of their compositione.
