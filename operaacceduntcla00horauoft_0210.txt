6. Saeculum Pyrrhae: Pyrrha was the wife of Deucalion, king

of Thessaly, in whose time the deluge came. Pyrrha may well‘

be thought to have complained of‘ strange prodigies? which the
Romansg were apprehensive were about to be renewed.
13. Flavum. ‚andi-s».- Our word‘ yellow’ but poorly expresses

the meaning ofjlavus, when applied to the ,Tibe‘r at, or near-to ,

Rome. This river is there deep, rapid, and exceedingly turbid‚
from the quantities of sand and loam usually blended with its wa-
ter; especially aster rainS, which give it a tawny or muddy color;

About the first of J anuary, 1830, the Tiber rose fourteen feet in ·.
twenty-four hours 3 and when it subsided, the alluvial deponite along ξ

or rather into the Anio, near where it empties into the Tiber, which

Rome, which Jupiter, as its tutelary divinity, did not approve.

Doering considers nimium an adjective, agreein with ultor-anu

“nimium non ad querenti, sed ad ultorem referen 11111 esse puto;
nimius enim fuit ultor Tiberis, sive modum in ulciscendo uxot-is
