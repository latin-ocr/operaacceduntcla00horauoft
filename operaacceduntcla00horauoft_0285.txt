THE SECULAR POEM.

Tms poem, designed to be sung at the celebration of the Secu-
lar Games‚ by a choir of fifty-four boys and girIS, an equal number
of each, is considered one of the most finished performances -of
antiquity. These games were celebrated once in an age, or
about a hundred years. They were instituted in consequence of
certain prophecies contained in the Sibylline Books, This cele-
bration was originally distinguished by three solemn festivals, which
were afterwards united in one festival, which continued three days
and three nights successively. The first celebration of the Secu-
lar Games was in the year of Rome 2453 the second was in 3053
the. third was in 505; the fourth was in 6053 and the fisth, for
which Horace wrote this poem, was in 737. It was therefore a
hundred and thirty-two years since the last celebration. The
