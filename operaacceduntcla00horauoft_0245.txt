ODE XVII.

Horace heie predicts the glory and immortality of his name.
And, with the true spirit of a poet, he imagines himself already as-
’ the form ⁴and faculties of a swan, and soaring above the
earth, over which he is about to take his ae‘rial ssight. As he will
leave the humble abodes of men, so he will shake off “ this mortal
coil,'’ and cease to be an object of human sympathy or sorrow·
‘He wishes not for the empty honors of a burial, nor the waste of
useless tears on his account, since he shall not die.

1. Νοπ usitatd . . . vates .· ‘I as a poet, in my two-sold charac-
ter, shall be borne, on no common or feeble wing, through the li-
quid aether.’—Usitat‹i .· this may mean ⁴ of no common or ordinary
kind ς’ οι· it may-mean simply ‘unused to flying.’—Bifimnis,· i. e.
part man and part swan. “ Binae formes, tam hominis, quam cycni
concessa eunt? Doer. ’ “

5. Non ego . . . obibo .· ‘I shall not, although the offspring of
humble parente, I shall not die, whom you, O Maecenas, call be-
loved.' I have given the common reading, and the usual render-
ing of the passage. But there seems to be some violence in sep-
arating dilecte Maecenas. Doering, with some others, point it
thus 3 non ego, quem vocas, Dilecte Maecenas, obibo ·.· and gives this
explanation: “non ego, ut homo vulgaris, qualem tu me nunc ap-
pelloe, dilecte Maenas, et qualis tibi esse videor, morti ero obnox-
imo„ ,

9. Jam jam . . . pelles.- ‘already a rough skin contracts upon
my legs ι’ i. e. they are assuming the appearance of a swan's
le . “

ἐ181. Supema .· ‘as to the parts above :' i. e. my body.

17. Me Colchus .· sc. noscet .· ‘the Colchian shall know me.’—
Et qui . . . Dacus : ‘ and the Dacian, who can dissemble his fear
of the Marsian cohort! The Marsi, a people of Latium, were
considered among the best of the Roman soldiers, and much to
be feared by their enemieS.

19. Peritus: sc. literarum.- ‘learned 3’ the Spaniards imitated
the Romans in cherishing a love of learning.

20. Discat .· i. e. “carnibus meis attentas aures praebebit.’' Doer.
These distant and different nations, the poet Saye, shall leam his
fune aud read his writingS.
