SATIRE ΙΙ.

The advantages of temperate living, in its effects both on the
. body and the mind, are set forth in this satire with much truth
and simplicity. They are represented as coming from an un-
lettered pensant, who delivers them without affectation, as the re-
sult of his own experience and observation.

sound sense and practical wisdom.
