SATIRE IV.

This satire consists of an amusing dialogue between the poet
and one Catius, who pretends to be a great philosopher, and 1:ileo
to be profoundly versed 111 the science bof cookery. But he be-
comes ridiculous by attaching so much importance to what is of
little consequence3 and more particularly by exposing his utter
ignorance of the subject on which he discourses. The whole is
a keen satire upon that class of men who place their supreme
happiness m the pleasures of the table. This he considers an
abuse of Epicureanism, in the refined forms of which he was him-
self a believer.
