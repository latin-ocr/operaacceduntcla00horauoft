’ ons 111.
Augustus had desired Horace to write two odes3 one upon the
Secular games3 and the other upon the conquests of Drusus and

Tiberius in Pannonia. The poet commences this ode with the
praises of Drusus, as it was his first campaign, and as he was more

· beloved by Augustus than Tiberius, In the XIIIth ode of this

book he continues the subject principally in praise of Tiberius.

1. Qualem . . . Vindelici.- the order of construction is, Qualem
olim juventas et patrius vigor propulit nido, inscium laborum, alitem
minismmsulmznia, (cui Jupiter, ret deorum, per-misit regnum in
vagas aves, expertus eum fidelem in rapiendo Ganymede flavo,) ver-
nique venti, nimbi-⁴1 jam remotis, docuere paventem insolitos nisus,-
φησι, 81¹0. . . . talem Vindelici 'videte Drusum gerentem bella sub
Βὴωέἰε Alpibus3-Alitem .· ‘the eagle.’—Mini3trum fulminis .· ‘the

commentators how these four verses came here. All admit them
to be unworthy of the' poet, and brought in without apparent rea-
son. Some suppose it may have been a common question, when
talking of the conquests of DrusuS, from whence the Vindelici de-
rived the custom of arming themselves with axes, like the
AmazonS. Others think they may have been written in ridicule of
some other poet, who had attempted to celebrate the same con-
quests, and used some such language.

24. Consiliis . . . revictae .- ‘vanquished by the wisdom of this
youthful prince?

28. In pueros . . . Nerones .- Tiberius and Drusus were the sons
of Tiberius Nero by Livia„ When Augustus married their mother,
Livia,'he adopted Tiberius and Drusus, and brought them up with
the same tenderness and care that he would have done, had they
been his own children.

35. Utcunque . . . culpoe .· ‘ whenever good precepts are wanting,
vices obscure the natural endowments)

38. Metaurum flumen .· Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, was
sent from Carthage with a powerful reinforcement to meet Han-
nibal in Italye, and had he succeeded, the fate of Rome would
have been settled. Claudius Nero, then encamped in sight of
Hannibal, secretly left his camp with a detachment of soldiers‚ and
defeated and slew Hasdrubal at the river Metaurus. The Cartha-
ginians did not even know of the departure of Nero, till he caused
the head of Hasdrubal to be thrown into their camp. This dispel-
